# topic-extraction

This project takes all news articles from https://doxydonkey.blogspot.com/ . </br>
The articles are cleaned and transformed using BeautifulSoup library and  TF-IDF .
It uses K- means clustering to identify the different topics to which the existing articles fall into and KNN to place new articles to the topics identified in the earlier step.
